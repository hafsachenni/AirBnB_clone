AirBnB CLONE - THE CONSOLE:
The airbnb-clone is the first step towards building our
full web appliction designed to replicate the functionality,
of the widely recognized AirBnB platform

DESCRIPTION:
-Create our data model
-Manage(create, update, destroy, etc) objects
-Store and persist objects to a file(JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system.
This storage engine will give us an abstraction between
My object and How they are stored and persisted.
This means from our console code
and from the front-end and RestAPI we will build later,
we wonâ€™t have to pay attention(take care) of how
our objects are stored.
This abstraction will also allow us to change
the type of storage easily without updating all codebases
The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
